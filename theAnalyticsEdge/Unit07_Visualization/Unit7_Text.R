# Visualizing Text Data Using Word CLouds
# Problem 1 - Preparing the Data
tweets <- read.csv("tweets.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
# 1) Create a corpus using the Tweet variable

install.packages("tm")
library(tm)
corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(tweets$Tweet))
# 2) Convert the corpus to lowercase 
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, tolower)
corpus = tm_map(corpus, PlainTextDocument)
# 3) Remove punctuation from the corpus
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)
# 4) Remove all English-language stopwords
corpus <- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
# 5) Build a document-term matrix out of the corpus
dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus)
# 6) Convert the document-term matrix to a data frame called allTweets
allTweets <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(dtm))
colnames(allTweets) <- make.names(colnames(allTweets))
# How many unique words are there across all the documents?
ncol(allTweets)
# What is the most compelling rationale for skipping the process of stemming words
# when visualizing text data?
# Use logic to answer the question

# Problem 4 - Selecting a Color Palette
# Install and load "RColorBrewer" package
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
library(RColorBrewer)
# Which color palette would be most appropriate for use in a word cloud for which we want to use color
# to indicate word frequency?
display.brewer.all()

# Which RColorBrewer palette name would be most appropriate to use when preparing an image for a document 
# that must be in grayscale?
# Look at the how the grey colors in each palette are presented. 
# Which of the following commands addresses this issue by removing the first 4 elements of the 9-color 
# palette of blue colors?
# Experience the codes to see how they work
