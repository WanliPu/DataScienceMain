# 239. Sliding Window Maximum
## Idea 
* Slide windows [ i - (k-1 ) , i ]
* If an element in the deque and it is out of i-(k-1), we discard them. We just need to poll from the head, as we are using a deque and elements are ordered as the sequence in the array
* Now only those elements within [i-(k-1),i] are in the deque. We then discard elements smaller than a[i] from the tail. This is because if a[x] <a[i] and x<i, then a[x] has no chance to be the "max" in [i-(k-1),i], or any other subsequent window: a[i] would always be a better candidate.
* As a result elements in the deque are ordered in both sequence in array and their value. At each step the head of the deque is the max element in [i-(k-1),i]

# Time
* O(n)
## Code 

```
public class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] n, int k) {
        if( n == null || k <= 0 ) return new int[0];
        int len = n.length;
        int[] res = new int[len-k+1];
        int index = 0;
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < len ; i++){
            // remove  numbers out o range k
            while( !deque.isEmpty() && deque.peek() < i - k + 1){
                deque.poll();
            }
            // remove smaller
            while( !deque.isEmpty() && n[deque.peekLast()] < n[i]){
                deque.pollLast();
            }
            deque.offer(i);
            if( i >= k - 1 ){
                res[index++] = n[deque.peek()];
            }
            
        }
        return res;
    }
}
