# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

## Idea
* Consider a sorted array 1111117, which is rotated to 1171111.
* Left = 3 and mid = 3, Search 7
* Therefore, the condition n[left] == n[mid] holds true, which leaves us with only two possibilities:
* Case 1 : All numbers between n[left] and n[right] are all 1's.
* Case 2 : Different numbers (including our target) may exist between n[left] and n[right].
* As we cannot determine which of the above is true, the best we can do is to move left one step to the right and repeat the process again.
* Therefore, we are able to construct a worst case input which runs in O(n), for example: the input 11111111...117.

## Time
* Worst case O(n)


## Code 

```
public class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] n, int target) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = n.length - 1;
        while( i <= j ){
            int m = i + ( j - i ) / 2;
            if( n[m] == target ) return true;
            //left half is sorted
            if( n[i] < n[m] ){
                if( target < n[m] && target >= n[i]){
                    j = m - 1;
                } else{
                    i = m + 1;
                }
            }
            //right half is sorted
            else if( n[i] > n[m] ){
                if( target > n[m] && target <= n[j]){
                    i = m + 1;
                } else {
                    j = m -1;
                }
            }
            else i++;
        }
        return false;
    }
